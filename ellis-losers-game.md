> Contrary to their oft articulated goal of outperforming the market averages, investment managers are not beating the market: The market is beating them.

Portfolio managers failing to produce positive absolute rates of return, they are also failing to produce positive *relative* rates of return.

Life itself is unfair.  To JFK: "Through the Catacysm"
> Among those who've had a wonderful life: two kinds of people, those who know they were lucky, those who haven't figured it out.

Fees are the big number.

Fees are small at 1%?  What is it's not 1%?

Assets already exist, you are buying the returns.

1% of assets, is how much of returns?!

Holy shit, fees are 15% of returns, but 1% of assets!

10bps get an Index Fund.  What if the incremental cost over the commodity product?  90bps.

What about the excess return for the best manager: maybe, avg 15bps (HERO-LEVEL) over average.  So the fee is 85% of the returns.

What is bad manager? Then the fee is INFINITE as a fraction of incremental value of the return.

1.  Fees are much higher than people realize.
2.  Return success does not repeat, in fact it mean reverts.



Understand your own skill set, and understand the competition.  Key to success in life is finding competition you know you can beat.
