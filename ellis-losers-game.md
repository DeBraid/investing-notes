Life itself is unfair.  To JFK: "Through the Catacysm"

Fees are the big number.

Fees are small at 1%?  What is it's not 1%?

Assets already exist, you are buying the returns.

1% of assets, is how much of returns?!

Holy shit, fees are 15% of returns, but 1% of assets!

10bps get an Index Fund.  What is the incremental cost over the commodity product?  90bps.

What about the excess return for the best manager: maybe, avg 15bps (HERO-LEVEL) over average.  So the fee is 85% of the returns.

What is bad manager? Then the fee is INFINITE as a fraction of incremental value of the return.

1.  Fees are much higher than people realize.
2.  Return success does not repeat, in fact it mean reverts.
