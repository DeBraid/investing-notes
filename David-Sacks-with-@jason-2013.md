Startups - David Sacks Founder of Yammer - TWiST#354

Lean Startups - not a fan.  Once you have traction, get fat fast.  Raise when you can.  Poor funding environments are hell, so when it rains put a pail out. 

4 Things he looks for in Startups.  3 out of 4 usually good enough.

1.  A 'Product Hook' 

A simple way to engage with the product, that is realistic and repeatable.  This is a starting point, the bootstrap/wedge that get the whole product moving.  'A simple product hook that a typical user can engage in'.

Some simple user interaction or behaviour that is easy, quick, valuable, repeatable.  For example, Paypal: email + credit card, Yammer: answer the question, 'what are you doing right now' for enterprise.

Traction is a good substiute for clear product hook. Users aleady there a good sign a hook exists

2. Solving a market problem that exists. 

Market broken or need a solution?  Does the solution have a problem to solve? 
 
3.  Distribution Model

Probably the single hardest of the 4.  Big internet out there, how do people find your product?   How does the product spread?  Virality is KEY.  Important because sales and marketing is EXPENSIVE. 

Solving the distribution problem is essential to success.  


4. 'NON-Copyablility' or a Moat/Monopoly potential.

Can someone just copy your idea and eat your lunch?  What makes your product fundamentally non-copyable? 

A network effect is the best defense.  First-mover advantage, could help.  How much confidence do you have the market won't erode into a bunch of copycat?
