# Fees and Investing 

Inspired by one of the [greatest essays][4] in the history of finance and investing, by the great Charles D. Ellis, CFA.

## What kind of Advice is Worth Paying for?

> Investment Fees should be calculated relative to returns, not assets.

When stated as a percentage of assets, average fees do look low — a little over 1% of assets for individuals and a little less than one-half of 1% for institutional investors. But the investors *already own those assets*, so investment management fees should really be based on what investors are getting in the returns that managers produce. 

## Calculated correctly, as a percentage of returns, fees no longer look low. Do the math. 

If returns average, say, 8% a year, then those same fees are not 1% or one-half of 1%. They are much higher — typically over 12% for individuals and 6% for institutions... Thus (correctly) stated, management fees for active management are remarkably high. 

> Incremental fees are somewhere between 50% of incremental returns and, because a majority of active managers fall short of their chosen benchmarks, infinity.

## What is worth paying for? 

Advice on taxes and financial planning, not investment/asset management is worth paying for.  We do the opposite: pay someone to manage our assets and slap together a UFILE at tax deadline.

Paying 2% of assets annually for someone to manage your investments through tactical asset allocation is a poor bargain. In practice, Cdn investors pay 10-12x what they should for investment advice.

Eg. Vanguard U.S. Total Market Index ETF (CAD-hedged) trades on the [TSX as VUS][1], and charges 0.16% annually.  Assume generous 8% return, the fee is 2% of incremental returns (16/800), vs. a mutual fund or advisor charging 2% of assets (or 25% of returns, 200/800).  

So relative fee for active mgmt is ~12.5x as expensive as buying a broad stock-based US or Global ETF and holding it. [Fees are infinite][2]! 

So at this point, by just avoiding fees, you're way ahead.  The *second advantage of index funds is behavioural*, but manifests in greater returns.  Simply buying and holding passive index funds will eliminate 'whipsawing' in and out of the market with ill timing on the whims of mostly bad advice.

## Needle and Haystacks, on stacks on stacks on stacks.

As Charley points out in this wonderful [MiB podcast, ~26 min mark][3] the odds of a super-smart, super human advisor beating the market and his peers in hyper-competitive financial industry is very low.  Compounding this problem is that fact that you or I as an investor has the burden of finding these star investors in advance!  

> There is no reliable way of predicting the markets, nor is it possible to predict which market participants will rise to superstar status.

This shows up in the data of investor returns.  Amazingly the market return (of say TSX or S&P index fund) is nearly DOUBLE that of the actual return that accrues to average investors (~6 vs 3 % per ann over the past 30yrs).  

Mr. Ellis draws the analogy of the best athlete you know personally playing in the NFL this Sunday.  It doesn't matter how good on is locally, or in the school gym, with the big boys, you will get killed.  The same thing applies with investing: the market is really crowded with exceptional, hard-working people.  Most trading activity (> 90%) is done by professionals who have more info and insights that average investor by factor of 10-1000x.  Don't play a game you know you can't win.   Oh, Mr. Ellis has another legendary essay on that too: [Winning the Losers Game][5].

This is a combo of high fees and bad behaviour (getting out at bottoms and buying at tops), but I was really shocked to learn this.  By anecdote, the best performing accounts of all-time at Fidelity (trillions in assets) are the ones that we're literally FORGOTTEN and completely untouched.  Often this occurred during decade-long legal battles, estates settlements and other bizarre cases of people forgetting they had money.  That these forgotten accounts had the best performance is telling of behavioural sabotage that plagues return rates.

## Where are the Customers Yachts? 

A great [tweet][6] from Cliff Asness sums up the active management debate: 

> This article encourages the super-wealthy to teach their kids to be active managers. A great cure for inequality!
