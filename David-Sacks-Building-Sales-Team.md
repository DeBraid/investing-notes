# How To Set Up A Sales Team

All about incentives.  Sales people are coin operated. 

Total comp: 50% base, 50% variable (commission)

Use 10% commission rate until they hit quota, then boost to 15%.

Given 10% CR, and 50% Commission for Salary, math is easy. 

If you want a $10k raise, we boost your quota by 10x (so, $100k).  Given the 15% bonus on over-quota sales, the trade off for sales person less attractive (could earn $15k bonus vs. new, added $10k base).

Keep the incentives aligned! 

Assume $500k quota, (team of 10, manager has 2.5% commision (10)).

Divide territory based on geography, do not allow territory overlaps. 

If reps are meeting 70-80% of quota every 6 months, keep hiring.  Once they dip below 70%, pause and reflect.

If you can't make the economics work, you might not have the pricing of your product correct, which means your startup is probably doomed.
