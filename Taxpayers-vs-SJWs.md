People vote with their dollars far more than ballots.

I fashion myself more taxpayer advocate, which you've correctly identified as a subclass of SJW. I feel justified in targeting the public sector for many reasons. Key takeaway from your reply is the tone of the messaging.

"I just think you lose supporters when you tell people what you think should be a higher priority than what someone else thinks."

This is true.  My advocacy can take an adversarial tone (my nature to be competitive!) and that can cloud the message.  These are contra to my mission to lower taxes and ensure financial security for all.

Why focus on public sector?

Mostly it comes down to choice and accountability. 

The key difference between public vs. private is choice.  One is free to choose what type of vehicle to buy, or where to shop for groceries, etc. Mad at VW or Toyota, you buy a Ford, or choose not to own a car these days!  Mad at Harper or Trudeau, too bad, the property tax bill and income taxes must be paid lest you risk being imprisoned!  Don't like VW, buy another car.  Don't like political leaders, pay up or go to jail.  Stark contrast here.

Because of this, I target the public sector.  Democracy is great, but has flaws.  We vote with our wallets many times a day/week, but rarely get to vote on issues or political leaders (more unelected public officials than elected... ugh).

Accountability and Transparency 

Corporations have a legal obligation to put themselves and their profits first, they have shareholders who exercise votes daily by buying and selling the stock.  The same is not true for politicians, who market themselves as 'servants to their constituents', and have fixed election terms measured in years.  The actions of corporations are in line with our expectations, but the actions of public figures are not.  

Politicians most often look out for themselves when deal making with each others bureaucrats and the business community.  This is because all humans are greedy.  Moral hazard exists everywhere, but there is more robust and sophisticated checks and balances in the private sector. 

Public sector is the worst of the two bad actors.  Deceiving voters by saying 1 thing, doing another, with less transparency and fewer disclosures, and limited accountability.  Many studies showing attrition (firing/layoff) is much lower in public sector, despite the empirical proof that private sector benefits from creative destruction (Schumpeter). 

Private corps are the relatively good actors (esp. since most private corps are not Exxon or Goldman Sachs, but small biz, with <100 employees). Private corps reports their audited financials in mandated disclosures every 12 weeks, without exception, re-state their mission and goals.  They hold a conference call where shareholders and professional business analysts can ask questions directly to the CEO and other company leaders.

Case Study: VW Emissions Scandal 

> "I didnt see Volkswagen punished by consumers."

A quick google shows sales are down meaningfully after they lied and deceived customers. https://www.google.ca/search?q=volkwagon+sales+since+the+emission+scandal&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA706CA708&oq=volkwagon+sales+since+the+emission+scandal&aqs=chrome..69i57.6366j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 

Additionally, the courts are forcing VW to issue refunds in the form of buying back the shitty emission machines they marketed as clean cars!

"TDI owners who purchased their cars before September 17, 2015, can sell their cars back to Volkswagen for between $12,500 and $44,000, depending on model, age, trim, and region. TDI lessees will receive a cash value between $2600 and $4900. Owners and lessees who sold their cars or quit their leases before June 28, 2016, are also eligible."

Few examples of such swift justice and meaning remuneration for similar blunders/scandals in the public realm.  VW is a great example of how leaders at private corporations face greater scrutiny and accountability than public servants when they err or deceive.
