## Process

Find companies intrinsic business value (present value of future cash flows).

Free cash flow yield (under a chequebook account approach).  We want min of 10%, higher the better.

These pioneers used accounting metrics.  Once commonplace, and replicable, they lost their signal value. 

## How important is growth? 

Growth vital input to calculation of value.  Faster growth, better company.

## How to estimate/forecast growth?
