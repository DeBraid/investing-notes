With ^^ that in mind:

1.  Raising corporate tax does not yield the intended effect.  Rather than receiving additional tax revenue, in practice it's more common to observe the opposite: raising corporate tax yields less in total tax revenue.   

2.  Individuals always bear the burden of greater taxation.  

Individuals collectively pay ~4x as much tax as corporations! ($200 billion in CIT, $800 billion annually from individuals).  So marginal tax increases are much easier to implement on the people, through automatic payroll deductions and the like, and just simply via scale.

The phenomena described by Gordon and others of tax-base elasticity should come as no surprise.  There are several (dozens?) of professional-class careers in finance, accounting and law whose primary goal is to help clients avoid taxation.  They churn out 50,000 page tax returns, domicile their headquarters in exotic tax havens like Delaware, Singapore and Isle of Man. 

The shit continues to roll downhill since these tactics are most common at the largest institutions! The small and medium sized business (that mostly operate domestically and generate millions, not billions, in revenue) take the hit since they can't afford the sophisticated legal & accounting advice.

This means lower wages and/or fewer jobs, bad news.

What is an average corp in Canada? 

87.4% of jobs are at firms with less than 20 employees! www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/02804.html

There are only ~45 public corporations in Canada with revenue over $10 billion annually.  For comparison, the annual budget for Toronto District School board is ~$3 billion.  There are only ~125 companies in Canada with sales exceeding this figure.  The corporate infrastructure in our wonderful country is not the big-bad corps in newspapers and on TV, but the small-med biz that are hanging onto life, fighting a daily battle for survival.  http://www.financialpost.com/news/fp500/2014/index.html?page=3

Distribution of jobs: 

Small (1–99 employees) - 7,745,704
Medium (100–499) - 2,247,780 
Large (500+) - 1,121,025 
Total Employment non-Small Business Jobs - 1,121,024
Statistics Canada https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/02805.html

Large businesses are not significant net creators of jobs, most new jobs (10x as many) come from new, fledgling firms. 

Small businesses play major role in net job creation, creating 77.7% all private jobs 2002-2012. In total, small businesses created ~100000 jobs PER YEAR on average over same time period. https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/02806.html

TD Economics estimated in the last 3 Canadian recessions, 85% of net job creation within the first 2 years of recovery came from small businesses.  So they are clearly more flexible and responsive in times of distress. 

Spending their money: 
Idea they are sitting on $600 billion in tax savings is questionable, and notion they aren't investing in jobs and training is certainly false as shown above.  Funds devoted to CAPEX (acquire, upgrade or fix physical assets such as plants, equipment or other property, excluding wages) has expanded in every year since 2010, growing from $346 billion to over $400B in 2014.  This is corps spending $400 billion a year in aggregate just to stay afloat, again this excludes wages, which is the largest single expense for most businesses. www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/busi03a-eng.htm

On Corporate Tax

Two important keys to focus on: 

1.  Raising corporate tax does not yield more tax revenue necessarily, in practice its more common to observe the opposite (raising corporate tax yields less in total tax revenue).

2.  Individuals collectively pay ~4x as much tax as corporations ($200 billion in CIT, $800 billion annually from individuals).

The phenomena described by Gordon and others of tax-base elasticity should come as no surprise when there several professional-class careers (accountants and lawyers) whose primary goal is to help their clients avoid taxation.  Churning out 50,000 page tax returns, domiciling their headquarters in exotic tax havens like Delaware, Singapore and Isle of Man.


From professor Stephen Gordon, economics professor at Laval.  (CIT = corporate income tax).

There is a negative relationship between CIT rates and CIT revenues: an increase in CIT rates actually reduces CIT revenues as a share of GDP. 

Of course, this result is almost entirely driven by the outlier that is Norway. But even if you discard Norway, you'd have a hard time extracting a significantly positive relationship between CIT rates and CIT revenues. As far as the Canadian experience goes, the steady reduction in CIT rates hasn't had much effect on revenues. 

The key concept in this literature is the *tax base elasticity*: the parameter describing how the CIT base responds to variations in the CIT rate.  Recent work in Canada finds strong evidence that CIT bases are highly sensitive to changes in tax rates. worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/03/cit.html

This is a BIG topic.  There is an entire class of professionals dedicated to accounting, and I am certainly not a CA.

What kinds of corporations exist in Canada? 

Most important thing to establish is that most corporation are more like the corner store than Magna or TD Bank.  Over 80% of corporations in Canada employ < 20 people (made these #'s up, point is the same: most corporations are not pulling billions in revenue and making steady profits.  They are in fact a class of losers: most businesses fail (90% fail right away, of the survivors some go public and nearly all those are dead within 10yrs).  Corporations are mostly smallish, highly volatile enterprises that are on a death spiral.

There are only ~45 public corporations in Canada with revenue over $10 billion annually.  For persective the annual budget for Toronto District School board is ~$3 billion.  There are only ~125 companies in Canada with sales exceeding this figure! Crazy how few business support the corporate infrastructure in our wonderful country. http://www.financialpost.com/news/fp500/2014/index.html?page=3

The sum of corporate income tax ~$200 Billion per year, small compared to the ~$800 Billion per year collected from individuals. worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/03/cit.html Terminated StatsCan series :( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&id=3800007

This is where it gets really complicated: who should be taxed, corps or people?  Should we tax income or consumption? What amount is the right to keep the economy healthy and our debt under control? All of these are moving targets.  There are proposals for alternative flat taxes

"facts is that we already have the lowest corporate tax rates in the G7 and conservatives say it's good because it attracts corporations here which is good for the economy as it provides jobs etc."
-- there are examples of success and failure in the low-corp tax shell game, here is a list and there are many countries with lower corp tax rates that I wouldn't care to live in, or even visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates. 

-- provision of jobs 


common rebuttal from the left is that all these corporations have done is sit on that excess tax savings and not invested at all. 
-- aggregate capex for the canadian corp sector is x% of GDP? http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/busi03a-eng.htm

-- Gross Fixed Capital Formation in Canada averaged 254241.66 CAD Million from 1981 until 2015, reaching an all time high of 409268 CAD Million in the fourth quarter of 2014 www.tradingeconomics.com/canada/gross-fixed-capital-formation

not in technology or processing, not in training for their employees or for raises. 


instead this tax savings is now on order of 600 plus billion or over 30 percent of our GDP. 
-- what tax savings?

Explain how wanting to raise the corporate tax rate a little so that we are still competitive globally 
-- corporate tax is mostly domestic issue, less global

but we can also get some of that 600 billion back is negative?
