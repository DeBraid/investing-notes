# Corporate Tax In Canada

### Summary 

1.  Raising corporate tax does not yield the intended effect.  Rather than receiving additional tax revenue, in practice it's more common to observe the opposite: raising corporate tax yields less in total tax revenue.   

2.  Individuals always bear the burden of greater taxation.  

3.  The character, financial position, contribution of 'an average' corporation is highly misunderstood.  Most firms are small or medium sized, whose employment and economic outputs are much greater than generally assumed. 

## Does raising corporate tax work? No.

From Stephen Gordon, economics professor at Laval. (CIT = corporate income tax): there is a negative relationship between CIT rates and CIT revenues, an increase in CIT rates actually reduces CIT revenues as a share of GDP. 

You'd have a hard time extracting a significantly positive relationship between CIT rates and CIT revenues. As far as the Canadian experience goes, the steady reduction in CIT rates hasn't had much effect on revenues. 

The key concept in this literature is the *tax base elasticity*: the parameter describing how the CIT base responds to variations in the CIT rate. Recent work in Canada finds strong evidence that CIT bases are highly sensitive to changes in tax rates.

## Who pays the tax? People, mostly.

Individuals collectively pay ~4x as much tax as corporations! ($200 billion in CIT, $800 billion annually from individuals).  So marginal tax increases are much easier to implement on the people, through automatic payroll deductions and the like, and just simply via scale.

The phenomena described by Gordon and others of tax-base elasticity should come as no surprise.  There are several (dozens?) of professional-class careers in finance, accounting and law whose primary goal is to help clients avoid taxation.  They churn out 50,000 page tax returns, domicile their headquarters in exotic tax havens like Delaware, Singapore and Isle of Man. 

The shit continues to roll downhill since these tactics are most common at the largest institutions! The small and medium sized business (that mostly operate domestically and generate millions, not billions, in revenue) take the hit since they can't afford the sophisticated legal & accounting advice.

This means lower wages and/or fewer jobs, bad news.

## Where do the jobs come from? 

87.4% of jobs are at firms with less than 20 employees! [Industry Canada](www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/02804.html)

There are only ~45 public corporations in Canada with revenue over $10 billion annually.  For comparison, the annual budget for Toronto District School board is ~$3 billion.  There are only ~125 companies in Canada with sales exceeding this figure.  The corporate infrastructure in our wonderful country is not the big-bad corps in newspapers and on TV, but the small-med biz that are hanging onto life, fighting a daily battle for survival.  via [FP](http://www.financialpost.com/news/fp500/2014/index.html?page=3)

Distribution of jobs: 

* Small (1–99 employees) - 7,745,704
* Medium (100–499) - 2,247,780 
* Large (500+) - 1,121,025 
* Total Employment non-Small Business Jobs - 1,121,024

Large businesses are not significant net creators of jobs, most new jobs (10x as many) come from new, fledgling firms. 

Small businesses play major role in net job creation, creating 77.7% all private jobs 2002-2012. In total, small businesses created ~100000 jobs PER YEAR on average over same time period. [Industry Canada](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/02806.html)

TD Economics estimated in the last 3 Canadian recessions, 85% of net job creation within the first 2 years of recovery came from small businesses.  So they are clearly more flexible and responsive in times of distress. 

## Corps spending their money? 

Idea they are sitting on $600 billion in tax savings is questionable, and notion they aren't investing in jobs and training is certainly false as shown above.  

Funds devoted to CAPEX (acquire, upgrade or fix physical assets such as plants, equipment or other property, excluding wages) has expanded in every year since 2010, growing from $346 billion to over $400B in 2014.  This is corps spending $400 billion a year in aggregate just to stay afloat, again this excludes wages, which is the largest single expense for most businesses. via [StatsCan](www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/busi03a-eng.html)
