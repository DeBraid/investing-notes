Sunshine List count in 2014: 111438 public servants.  

Income breakdown for Ontario only from [StatsCan](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil105g-eng.htm) shows income > $100,000 -> 766,990 Ontarians, or 14.5%.  This raw arithmetic used a lower bound.

Below, I make an adjustments to account for the other significant differences known to exist between public and private employment.  On average public servants enjoy an advantage in all of the following areas: pension, retirement age, job loss, absenteeism. via [Fraser Inst.](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/comparing-government-and-private-sector-compensation-in-canada.pdf)  

Given the above (an entire paper trying to estimate/value total compensation diffs, concludes ~10%), I'd lean towards using those income > $150,000 (which is -> 265,550 Ontarians) as the proper private sector comparable.  Using this income group, public servants represent 42% of 'high income earners'. 

The real number is somewhere between 14.5% and 42%, I'd skew towards the high end.
