# Chris Dixon on This Week In Startups [via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe4ceqA4pqU&ab_channel=ThisWeekInStartups).

Some rough notes on the interview with entrepreneur/VP after recently joining a16z in 2013 (a16z, or Andreessen Horowitz is a $4 billion venture capital firm, founded in 2009 by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. [via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz)).  Below are snippets summarizing the interview, quotes are paraphrased. 

## Why would a successful entrepreneur want to join a VC firm? 

CD:  Major difference in the lifestyle, stress levels.  After 2 venture-backed startups, not sure I wanted to do it again.  Nice thing about investing is that you get to ride along with some excitement, but less intense.  

> If you get sick 1 day as a VC, the entire organization doesn't fall apart, where as an entrepreneur, it does.

Wrestled with the idea of starting another company vs. doing some investing.  Building stuff is fun, but the stress is much greater.   

> The Betaworks-type model, done by Ev Williams, Kevin Ryan, et al is hard to pull off since your attention is divided. 

Though about trying something like Betaworks.  However, the idea of mitigating risk by starting more than 1 company at a time is a likely a fantasy, very to do successfully.  More recruiting, less focus, many have tried, few succeeded at this buck-shot entrepreneurial style.

##  Why has a16z made others VCs nervous? 

Simple way to view it: competitive aspects to new entrants. a16z est. in 2009, I think*).  Given only 10-20 good deals in all of VC per year.  Seqoua, Kleiner Perkins, Excel, etc. saw a new top-tier firm on the block.

CD: more radical way, a brand new model of VCs.  "Entreps pick the VCs, not the other way around".  Back when, capital was scare, and VC were scare, and entrepreneurs were not as savvy. 

Now term sheets are being shared, the pitch decks are more polished.  Information flow has increased, which in addition to abundant capital, means more fertile group for entrepreneurs.  

> How could you possibly hate on this?  It's a great trend for the world

## About a16z

a16z strives to service entrepreneurs, not just as provider capital.  They do so by creating a large team (~10x team members to partners), and the salaries are much greater for the operating staff than the investment partners.  Equity obviously favours the partners.

7 total investors put up the capital, and they share in the risk/upside to great extent, but 60 operating partners get the lions share of salary.

5 groups of staff in operations:

* research group
* tech recruiting
* executive recruiting 
* corporate development (M&A, strat debt, 5 professional bankers, etc)
* ?

Emphasize technology: CTO conferences daily, not annually like most VC firms.

a16z is outsourcing all areas of start ups so CEOs and founders can focus on product and growth. The non-growth and non-product development elements of business: operating, raising capital, staffing, financial and regulatory, and legal guidance is off-loaded onto a16z.  

Their investment in this area is rewarded by attracting the best entrepreneurs who are eager to out-source all the unsexy and difficult nonspecific jobs to be done.

## General Strategy 

Accept money from a corp like Samsung or Ford? 

CD: Having people offering you money is a high-class problem.  Be aware of the terms with any deal, sometimes the right partner can be helpful. 

#### Partners 

CD: Citibank is better as co-investor than a direct competitor.  

## Trends in VC Partners 

Less MBAs, more former entrepreneurs.  

CD:  Used to be modeled after a hedge fund: the best stock pickers got hired as VCs.  Now that capital is abundant, the winners are the VCs who can help the client the most.  Who does the entrepreneur want to work with? 

Blogging is wildly underrated. *A sign perhaps that tech journalism is so awful that anyone who actually knows what they're talking about will gain respect and blow up. 

> CD: One of my rules is never say something negative about an early-stage startup.

Starting a company is so hard that writing negatively about a young startups is simply cruel, and rarely productive.  Tech world doesn't need more critical posts, especially about small startups.  It's fascintaing how small business is applauded universally in non-startup spaces, but technology firms tend to be viewed skeptically.  

>  Tech startups are one of the few areas consistently creating jobs and improving the quality of life broadly.
