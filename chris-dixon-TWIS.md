# Chris Dixon on This Week In Startups [via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe4ceqA4pqU&ab_channel=ThisWeekInStartups).

Some rough notes on the interview with entrepreneur/VP after recently joining a16z in 2013 (a16z, or Andreessen Horowitz is a $4 billion venture capital firm, founded in 2009 by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. [via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz)).  Below are snippets summarizing the interview, quotes are paraphrased. 

## Why would a successful entrepreneur want to join a VC firm? 

CD:  Major difference in the lifestyle, stress levels.  After 2 venture-backed startups, not sure I wanted to do it again.  Nice thing about investing is that you get to ride along with some excitement, but less intense.  

> If you get sick 1 day as a VC, the entire organization doesn't fall apart, where as an entrepreneur, it does.

Wrestled with the idea of starting another company vs. doing some investing.  Building stuff is fun, but the stress is much greater.   

> The Betaworks-type model, done by Ev Williams, Kevin Ryan, et al is hard to pull off since your attention is divided. 

Thought about trying something like [Betaworks, via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betaworks): 

> a hybrid investor/builder model has led to both investments in fast-growing startups (Tumblr, Airbnb, Groupon and Twitter) as well as more exclusive stakes in internally built startups (Chartbeat, Bitly and SocialFlow). Founded in 2007 by John Borthwick and Andy Weissman.  

However, idea of mitigating risk by starting more than 1 company at a time is a likely a fantasy, very to do successfully.  More recruiting, less focus, many have tried, few succeeded at this buck-shot entrepreneurial style.

##  Why has a16z made others VCs nervous? 

Simple way to view it: competitive aspects to new entrants. a16z established in 2009 shook the industry of well-entreched incumbants.  Given only 10-20 good deals in all of VC per year,  Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Excel, et al, saw a new top-tier firm on the block with real potential to get quality deal flow.

CD: more radical way to view creation of a16z as a *brand new model* of VC.  

> Entreps pick the VCs, not the other way around.  

Previously, capital was scare, VC were scare, and entrepreneurs were not as savvy.  In 2013-present, term sheets are being shared, pitch decks are highly polished.  *Information flow* has increased, which in addition to abundant capital, means more fertile group for entrepreneurs.  

## About a16z

a16z strives to service entrepreneurs, not just as provider capital.  They do so by creating a large team (~10x team members to partners), and the salaries are much greater for the operating staff than the investment partners.  Equity obviously favours the partners.

7 total investors put up the capital, and they share in the risk/upside to great extent, but 60 operating partners get the lions share of salary.

5 groups of staff in operations:

* research group
* tech recruiting
* executive recruiting 
* corporate development (M&A, strat debt, 5 professional bankers, etc)
* ?

Emphasize technology: CTO conferences daily, not annually like most VC firms.

a16z is outsourcing all areas of start ups so CEOs and founders can focus on *product and growth*. The non-growth and non-product development elements of operating a business like raising capital, staffing, financial, regulatory and legal guidance is off-loaded onto a16z.  

Their internal investment in these critical, but nonspecific, areas is rewarded by attracting the best entrepreneurs.  The CEOS and Founders are eager to out-source all the unsexy and difficult nonspecific jobs to be done.

## General Strategy 

Accept money from a corp like Samsung or Ford? 

CD: Having people offering you money is a high-class problem.  Be aware of the terms with any deal, sometimes the right partner can be helpful. 

#### Partners 

CD: Citibank is better as co-investor than a direct competitor.  

## Trends in VC Partners 

Less MBAs, more former entrepreneurs.  

CD:  Used to be modeled after a hedge fund: the best stock pickers got hired as VCs.  Now that capital is abundant, the winners are VCs who help the client the most.  Who does the entrepreneur want to work with? 

Blogging is wildly underrated.  Perhaps a sign that tech journalism is so poor that anyone who actually knows what they're talking about will gain respect and blow up. 

> CD: One of my rules is never say something negative about an early-stage startup.

Starting a company is so hard that writing negatively about a young startups is simply cruel, and rarely productive.  Tech world doesn't need more critical posts, especially about small startups.  It's fascintaing how small business is applauded universally in non-startup spaces, but technology firms tend to be viewed skeptically.  

>  Tech startups are one of the few areas consistently creating jobs and improving the quality of life broadly.


## Tension between VCs and Founders

Why do VCs block sales of a company?

CD: the VC has a portfolio, when they're approached by a founder with a desire to sell they are faced with reality of having 1 less portfolio company, and likely no future with this company.  In contrast, founders have a singular focus on that company, and are eager to cash out for various personal and financial reasons.  In many cases the founder is benefiting tremendously from a sale, and the VC less so.

## M&A

CD: Companies are trying to control the whole stack.  Startups can benefit from owning a piece of that stack and waiting for a major player to gobble them up. 

*On Google*: Since Larry came back, the execution has been unbelievable.  Aside from core business, they're doing tons of futuristic stuff: mobile, maps, autonomous cars, etc.

On apps and OS's: its driven by developers.  Whoever has the developers wins.  Hardware mostly commoditized.  

*On Apple*: their native software is being crushed by google (maps, mail, browsers, etc).  No one likes the software (iOS is great, but the specific apps are not up to standards).  

*On Amazon*: dominating retail, and cloud services, and still have their visionary founder.  

## Closing

Being a VC is so much better than being a founder.

> Prior to starting my last company a friend told me get ready to feel sick to your stomach for the next 6 years.
