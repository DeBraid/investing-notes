# Chris Dixon on This Week In Startups [via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe4ceqA4pqU&ab_channel=ThisWeekInStartups).

Some rough notes on the interview with entrepreneur/VP after recently joining a16z.  Mostly paraphrase and summarizing. 

## Why would a successful entrepreneur want to join a VC firm? 

CD:  Major difference in the lifestyle, stress levels.  After 2 venture-backed startups, not sure I wanted to do it again.  Nice thing about investing is that you get to ride along with some excitement, but less intense.  

> If you get sick 1 day as a VC, the entire organization doesn't fall apart, where as an entrepreneur, it does.

Wrestled with the idea of starting another company vs. doing some investing.  Building stuff is fun, but the stress is much greater.   

Though about trying something like Betaworks.  However, the idea of mitigating risk by starting more than 1 company at a time is a likely a fantasy, very to do successfully.  More recruiting, less focus, many have tried, few succeeded at this buck-shot style of entrepreneurism.

> The Betaworks-type model, done by Ev Williams, Kevin Ryan, et al is hard to pull off since your attention is divided. 

##  Why has a16z made others VCs nervous? 

Simple way to view it: competitive aspects to new entrants. (a16z est. in 2009, I think*).  Given only 10-20 good deals in all of VC per year.  Seqoua, Kleiner Perkins, Excel, etc. saw a new top-tier firm on the block.

CD: more radical way, a brand new model of VCs.  "Entreps pick the VCs, not the other way around".  Back when, capital was scare, and VC were scare, and entrepreneurs were not as savvy. 

Now term sheets are being shared, the pitch decks are more polished.  Information flow has increased, and this plus abundant capital means more fertile group for entrepreneurs.  *How could you possibly hate on this? 


a16z is about services entrepreneurs, not just giving them money.  Most of the money that goes out the door goes to the operating partners.

7 investors put up the capital, and they share in the risk/upside to great extent, but 60 operating partners get the lions share of the. 

5 groups 

research group
tech recruiting
executive recruiting 
corp development (M&A, strat debt, 5 professional bankers, etc)

CTO conference daily.

a16z is outsourcing all none-growth and product development elements of business: they provide capital and operating, hiring, financial and regulatory guidance.

3.  Strategy 

Accept money from a corp like Samsung or Ford? 

CD: Having people offering you money is a high-class problem.  Be aware of the terms with any deal, sometimes the right partner can be helpful. 


4.  Partners 

CD: Citibank is better as co-investor than a direct competitor.  

5.  Trends in VC Partners 

Less MBAs, more former entrepreneureurs.  

CD:  Used to be modelled after a HF: who are the best stock pickers.  Now that capital is abundant, the winners are the VCs that can help the client the most.  Who does the entrepreneur want to work with? 

Blogging is wildly underrated. -- Hint: tech journalism is so awful that anyone who actually knows whats happening blows up. 

> one of my rules is never say something negative about early stage startups.

It's so hard, that blogging negatively about a young startups is simply negative and cruel.  Tech world doesn't need more critical posts, its one of the few areas of that is creating jobs and improving the quality of life for others.

6.  TA Summit (backload diligence )

Some greasy operators will sign a term sheet, lock up a competitive deal.
