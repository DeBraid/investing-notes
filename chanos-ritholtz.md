# Jim Chanos on Masters in Business w/ Barry Ritholtz 


## What is Short Selling? 

Really forensic accounting.  Fundamental short selling has its roots in detecting abnormalities in operations or financials or both.

Exposed the largest security frauds in history: Baldwin Piano (selling obscure insurance contracts).  Enron -- mark to market accounting (favourable regulation for energy company).

Combo of insider selling + executive departures = TROUBLE

> Enron was essentially a leveraged hedge fund with a pipeline.  They would trade anything.


## Buyback

Only earning 6% pre-tax on capital.  Why would you pay 6x NAV (6% RoE) -- no!

accounting wins and losses differently.

Matching similar gains and losses.

gains marked thru operating income line,
losses held as discontinued asset, for a year, then disregarded as extrordiary event.

put losers below operating income line, by depreciating them.

odd footnotes: executive set up entities, where Sr Exec fo company is trading with them. How can you be counter party to yourself? 

McKinsey came up with the idea (accounting gimmick) to do the above, and sell to themselves.

short sellers -- create a hedge (insurance policies), that pays polite premiums. 

Short selling hedge funds is effectively an insurance business. 


Bankers when to congress: 

-- relax account rules (allow us to mark to market)
-- ban short selling

So hide, obfusicate, and distract.  Not acknowledge their prfilgate lending.

Willful blindness in financial history class.  Case based of investment fraud (back to 1690's).  See Yale class taught by Chanos.

Virtually all major frauds have been uncovered by journalists, short sellers.  Not auditors or regulators.

"Blame the Shorts" (book reco)

Buybacks 

"every CEO thinks their stock is undervalued"

Corp USA pre tax return on capital mid-high teams.  Equity market roughly 1/2 that.

Thus CEO + massive buy backs = happy to earn market return (or 1/2 that of a good firm). OR rate of return on new capital project is less than that which you can get in the equity market.

So they are buying the market instead of investing in their operations.

Dell spent more money on buybacks then they have earned in their entire lifetime.

CEOs are terrible market timers.  Applies to M&A.  Corp activity is not a leading indicator, its a laggard.

M&A -- replacing capex (capital spending or R&D) -- this should be deducted from FCF.  Capitalizing their R&D is a bad play, esp in big tech.

Revenues are bolstered by big aqcistions that done with debt.  R&D not expensed, but capitalized, and thus earnings are overstated.  (Depreciate their acquisitions, rather then expensive R&D).

Ability to Herg Greenberg 'cookie-jar' the earning through aquisiotns.
