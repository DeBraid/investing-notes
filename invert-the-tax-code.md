# Invert the Tax Code: Encourage Good, Discourage Evil

The tax code needs to be inverted, with a focus placed on taxing consumption and not income.  

2015/16 features an increasing in news attention towards `basic income`, a movement likely driven by US election cycle.  The goal is to provide welfare in a more effcient manner, based on ideal of one having minimum level of income.  

> Income is good!  But we tax it in odd ways. 

Taxes come from 2 main sources: 

* income 
	* payroll tax, capital gains tax, dividend taxes, etc
* consumption  
	* sales taxes like HST (formerly GST, general sales tax, and PST, provincial sales tax) 


Having hundreds of special rules for thousands of different income sources is madness. Quants need to step up and take over the tax code: flat tax, skewed towards consumption and not income.  

Using a flat tax for consumption (GST), but magically rate-setting taxes on income creates problems.  We're fearful that consumption taxes will reduce demand for goods, but ignore the counterbalancing increase to incomes. 

## Free the Human Capital

There is an entire professional class dedicated to managing taxation (accountants)!  Another professional class designed to audit, and authentic (lawyers, other accountants), and more (CFOs, CGA, CMA, etc).  

> How many wasted hours of human capital are spent on both sides of the ledger? 

Too many.

## Incentives 

Consumption is not created equal, and we already tax certain forms of consumption prohibitively (cigarettes, gasoline).  The simplicity of a single tax drove many provinces to recently Harmonize their dual sales taxes (PST and GST).  

Selectively (and prohibitively) taxing entities know to cause harm makes sense.  A carbon tax is predicted on the knowledge that certain types of consumption are better than others.  

An example of a tax on something good: dividend income.  Does this sound like an effective way to tax a business?

> GRIP: A Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) or a deposit insurance corporation may pay eligible dividends to the extent of its general rate income pool (GRIP)—a balance generally reflecting taxable income that has not benefited from the small business deduction or any other special tax rate—without incurring Part III.1 tax. The GRIP is calculated at the end of the tax year. However, a corporation can pay eligible dividends over the course of the year as long as, at the end of the year, the eligible dividends paid do not exceed its GRIP. 

Excess complexity create inefficiency.  A simplified approach to taxation would benefit everyone domestically, and attract investment from abroad.  Whomever figures this out first wins a global chess match for (productive) white-collar workers, not the accountants*.


* Sorry accountants and tax professionals: a simplification of the tax code will significantly hurt your industry.  However, you're all smart folks with business savvy, so you'll do fine.  The rest of the economy will thank you.
