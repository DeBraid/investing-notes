# The Tax Code Needs to be Inverted. 


Having hundreds of special rules for thousands of different income sources is madness. Quants need to step up and take over the tax code: flat tax, skewed towards consumption and not income.  

Using a flat tax for consumption (GST), but magically rate-setting taxes on income should be inverted: certain types of consumption should be encouraged/discouraged (food and fossil fuel consumption) while all income should be encouraged with a limited/marginal, progressive (tiered) flat tax.

 

GRIP: A Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) or a deposit insurance corporation may pay eligible dividends to the extent of its general rate income pool (GRIP)—a balance generally reflecting taxable income that has not benefited from the small business deduction or any other special tax rate—without incurring Part III.1 tax. The GRIP is calculated at the end of the tax year. However, a corporation can pay eligible dividends over the course of the year as long as, at the end of the year, the eligible dividends paid do not exceed its GRIP.
