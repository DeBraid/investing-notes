# Canada’s Innovation Conundrum: Five Years After the Jenkins Report

> In conclusion, then, improved innovation is the only sustainable source for Canada’s future economic growth

Sadly R&D spending in Canada peaked during DOTCOM era! This [chart][2] shows the lasting decline in various industries.

This is due to many sectors operating with benefit of oligopoly status: telecommunications, financial services, agriculture and transportation.

Since 2000, Canada’s productivity growth has been less than 1% per year, while in the United States it has averaged 2%.

The Jenkins report recommend consolidating the 60 random Federal government programs for innovation/R&D into 1, and reducing SRED (which was bloated compared to global peers).

None of these expensive programs are working, so consolidate and try again....

Then created more bizarre funding apparatus that no one understands (IRAP and the BDC). 

How Innovation Really Works?

Advocating more and better business R&D support is too simple. It is based on a linear model of innovation where basic research leads to invention (often patentable), which in turn moves on to development and engineering, and then to product commercialization. 

The linear model was more applicable in the past when large corporate R&D facilities fed a pipeline of products. 

Most businesses in a modern economy operate at a much smaller scale, and can do more with much less. In many sectors, speed and agility, supported by technology, are the keys to success. 

> Innovation often starts with demand: a market opportunities and creatively developing disruptive business strategies 

Call it a “skate to where the puck is going” approach, or a startup finding product-market fit.

In OECD speak, this is: "roughly 80 percent of most modern economies involves firms that perform little or no R&D, yet many of them innovate in terms of business models, processes, marketing, and organization."

In a16z speak: software is eating the world. 

Solutions: 
# Promote competition in Canada 
The global marketplace is driven by fierce competition and perhaps "more driven by quality than by price". 

Cut red tape and encourage new firm formation with startup capital.

> Highly skilled people and risk capital — suffer from a type of market failure to the extent that supply is inefficiently low, thereby effectively capping new opportunities in Canada. 

# Invest in highly skilled people

There is the perennial challenge of funding for high-risk, high-return businesses.  The US invests 2.5-3x more in venture capital per capita than Canada.

> The market failure in this case relates to the
risk-averse culture of the financial sector, compounded by a small base of angel capital
investors and an immature venture capital sector that has arguably been Balkanized by
public policy.

Further initiatives to support startup funding "would likely have greater long-term economic payoff than equivalent expenditures on R&D support."
