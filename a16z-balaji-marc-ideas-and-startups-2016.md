### How Should Founders Think About Startups 

From either the perspective of the founder, entrepreneur or investor, how should we think about startups? 

There is a formula that most venture capitalists follow which can be *simplified* into 3 parts: 

* market
* product
* team

The distinction between VC firms lies in their prioritization of these 3 general factors.  Some (like Sequoia) prefer ripe markets, and Google X prefers team. 

Peter Theil probably prioritizes product over team.  He will tolerate flaws in people and market so long as the product is revolutionary or sufficiently apt to scale. 

For students, focus on team.  Its hard to evaluate market and product.  But good people are always hard to find.  Working with the right people is a great for learning, and it will establish network effects. 

Look for exceptionalism in 1 dimension.  Invest in strength, not lack of weakness.  Being well rounded and "everything is good" is less attractive to VCs that 1 spectacular attribute. 

Strongest startups aren't often the ones with no flaws, but the ones with many warts by a revolutionary product/market.

### Sales 

> Default state of every company is dying in obscurity.

So how do you get people to notice you?  Every startup starts as hallucination, an idea on the back of a napkin that literally doesn't exist.

The math is 50/50 in VC.  The failure rate is very high.  So you also need to invest in things that are new and under the radar, and get lucky, to succeed. 

### IPOs

A legitimizing event.  Customers feel like they can understand the business and be more comfortable buying as a result.

Having stock creates value that you can leverage, it is a currency to be used (for M&A perhaps).

Number of public companies peaked in 1997.  Now down by 2/3rds (most companies go out of business).

Historically tech IPOs were individuals, now it's mostly funds.  This is a sign of less speculation in technology. 

Staying private means bigger, more audacious projects.

Going public means discipline and rigor of 12-week corporate springs (reporting, analysts, etc).

### Future of Raising Capital   

DAO -- new experimental method for financing (maybe 5-10 years out from mainstream adoption). 

### Bitcoin 

BTC is a fundamental technology.  We're in the TROUGH of the Gartner Hype Cycle, turns out its really hard to work with this emergent technology.

Blockchain is at the top the of hype cycles.  Implementations have been limited. 


Another way to find value is to look in the dumpster (cigar butts).  Things that have been written-off could revive as the hype cycle propagates. Do a start up
