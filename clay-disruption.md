Uses case study of steel industry! 

Massive, integrated steel companies ($10 billion in start up cap today).

vs. mini mills (melt scrap).  They be used to make steel of any quality for 20% lower costs.

Despite this, not a single large integrated company has used this strategy.  Steel market is comprised of tiers. 

Until 1979, when price of re-bar steel dropped 20% almost overnight. 

Strategy simple: low cost only works as long as high cost competition exists in the market.

Once the last high-cost integrated mill left the re-bar business, prices collapsed and the mini-mills beat each other up until costs plummeted. 

Same thing happened up the value chain (angle iron, bar and rod vs. structural steel vs. sheet steel), in 1984 rod and bar steel was commoditized. 

In EVERY case, the low-cost mini-mills would go up the value-add chain, driving the prices down. 

Why we're the manages alert to this?!  Because everytime they left the business, their profitablity got better! 

This is the innovators dilemma.  Pursuit of profit is the causal mechanism.  To kill a giant, one aught to define a business where you enter below, taking out the low-haning profits, then the incumbant is incentivized to flee rather than compete.  

Profitablity improved at the integrates because they were out-competed on price for their lowest profit products. 

Same practice with cars.

new entrants steal the bottom of the market, since incumbants are unwilling to defend the lowest-profit segment of their market. 

Disruptive Innovators transform complicated expensive products into simpler and more affordable ones.

All net jobs created in the last 100 years are from disruptive innovators.  They need capital to finance growth.

Sustainable innovations are different, they are like the steps from mainframes, to PCs, to mobile (make very good products better).  On average, this kind of innovation doesn't create jobs.  These don't require much capital either, but critically, they don't create net new jobs.

Effciency innovations: selling the same products, but cheaper (Walmart, Amazon, etc). 

Japan died because they rapidly disrupted, then stopped.  Once you get to the top of the market, the margins are great, but customers are harder to come by.
