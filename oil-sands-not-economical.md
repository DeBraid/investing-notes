Two questions here: 

a. how should governments respond to economic stress
b. is Canadian oil economical? How soon until oil is obsolete?  

My goal is to help the people of Alberta, and anyone negatively impacted by lower prices have a prosperous future.   

Those working in the oil industry have lost their jobs, and no one ever wants to see layoffs and headcount reductions close to home. 

Growing up in Hamilton, Ontario gave me a front-row seat to the role of government aid in struggling businesses and communities. 

It does not work as intended, and at worst is a complete waste of time and money. 

Once a booming steel town, Hamilton is trapped in sink hole created by non-competitive industry, and anchored by harmful government intervention that prevents the market from clearing.

Two ways to look at the economic stuggles of Alberta.  

1.  Corporate bailouts are bad. 
2.  Free trade is good.
3.  Oil is in a secular decline, and will be obsolete within 2-3 decades. 


## Oil will be obsolete 

Are we ok with the ethics of pumping and burning fossil fuels?  How can we reconcile the desire for cheap energy, thus low cost goods and services, with the need for a healthy planet? 

"Policy is hurting the Canadian oil industry" is a fabrication created by the Cdn oil indsutry. 

Lack of salable product is the issue.  Athabasca tar sands are among the most costly to produce on earth, according to Wall Street Journal:

> Most production growth in Canada comes from oil sands deposits in the remote boreal forests of northern Alberta, which have some of the industry's highest capital costs and longest development timelines.  

Because of this, Canadian crude trades at a substantial discount to other North American grades due to its low quality and limited pipeline access to market. graphics.wsj.com/oil-barrel-breakdown/   

Compared to global oil-producing peers, Canada is huge laggard.  Is it plausible that Canadian oil producers will ever be able to compete?  My guess is no. 

Canadian oil industry is not competitive on a global level, it  2.bp.blogspot.com/-xuJRGsqPNQE/UNHinILedCI/AAAAAAAANjA/jZNdU2XAsZk/s640/cost_of_production_vs_quantity_production_2010.png

How does Canada make oil production profitable under these competitive pressures?  Commodities are well known to trend towards depreciation, rather than depreciation. 

## Protectionism: Buy Canada doesn't work. 

Most if, not 100%, of the food, clothing and home furniture we buy is not made in Canada?  Global trade is here to stay (because it is such a fabulous enabler of prosperity).  If you support protectionist measure to support/bailout the Cdn oil sector, then you're support higher prices for the goods and services that all Canadians consume. 

We don't need to double the math on this: higher oil prices is a net positive for all Canadians, because we're all households consume energy.

Crude oil consumption in Canada has plateaued for a decade... http://www.indexmundi.com/energy/?country=ca&product=oil&graph=consumption

Fun thought experiment: how much should one save to protect their lifestyle in troubled times?  How should we view people who fall on hard times following a massive boom period?  Should these people and companies not be more equipped for the bust?  Fat to survive the winter?

Support robust and easy to use EI.  You know what we used to call that: SAVINGS.  Of course, Canadians aren't saving, in fact they're broke!  Savings rates below 5% since 1995: http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=canadapersav&v=201610011445o&d1=19160101&d2=20161231&h=300&w=600%27%20height=%27300%27%20width=%27600

We live on debt, in so doing the risks of job loss are magnified.  Total private credit has grown ~4x since 1998...  this chart is stagerring http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=canadapriseccre&v=201610121318o&d1=19160101&d2=20161231&h=300&w=600' height='300' width='600

"There are 1.3 billion people in China that want to have the same quality of life that you and I have."

Fine, but there life will be different because it taking place in the future, not the past.

To assume their energy consumption will have a similar distribution to recent history is a farce.  You are drawing cartoon lines, and telling lies with data.


## Solar Is Coming ... and is Nuclear

It is far more likely that the status quo changes dramatically in the energy industry than stasis.  The future does not look like the past in global energy markets.

### Nuclear

Largest barrier to more nuclear power is human error.  The misconception that nuclear can be bad, harmful, dangerous, but so are all other forms of energy.  When grading on a curve.  Engineers know what the public doesn't: there is plenty of potential for safe, clean, and sustainable nuclear. Lets invest here, rather than oil.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZXUR4z2P9w

### Solar 

Watch Standford professor Tony Seba on future of energy. This talk, titled "Clean Disruption - Why Energy & Transportation will be Obsolete by 2030 - Oslo, March 2016" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxryv2XrnqM

Seba asserts that four technology categories will disrupt energy and transportation by:
1- Batteries / Energy Storage
2- Electric Vehicles
3- Self-Driving Vehicles
4- Solar Energy

The outcome of the Clean Disruption is that by 2030 
• All new vehicles will be electric.
• All new vehicles will be autonomous (self-driving).
• Oil will be obsolete
• Coal, natural gas and nuclear will be obsolete
• 80+ per cent of parking spaces will be obsolete.
• Individual car ownership will be obsolete.
• All new energy will be provided by solar (and wind)

Clean Disruption is a technology disruption. Just like digital cameras disrupted film and the web disrupted publishing, Clean Disruption is inevitable and it will be swift. 

This is not a wonk radical spewing non-sense, this talk is backed by real trends in electrical engineering, materials and computer science.  Solar is now economical without subsidies and within 5-10 years will be adequate for regions with modest sunlight.
