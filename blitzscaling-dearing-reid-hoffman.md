### How to Think about Financing 

A lot of VCs are funding ventures that are not businesses.  They are either public goods, science projects or hobbies.

> Nobody came to this country because they wanted great convertible debt terms.

Convertible debt is a terrible poison in the VC industry.  People want ownership.  *Ownership ensures the best long term custodianship of assets.*  Humans want to produce things and then sell them later for more money, investors should also share ownership and be truly exposed and engaged.  

Founders should treat themselves to investors who rise and sink with their stake in your venture.

VC math should be simple: Total Investment / ownership %.
