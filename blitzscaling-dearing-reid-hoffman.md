# Video with Reid Hoffman and Michael Dearing (Lecture + Q&A) [via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vCdfa_aeI8&ab_channel=GreylockPartners)

Dearing gives a history of capitalism, makes a great case that entrepreneurs are critical for growth of social and financial capital. 

Dearing says capitalism is like a self-cleaning oven, in 3 wonderful steps:

1. creative / destructive power of entrepreneurs 
2. visible hand of managers
3. investing industrial wealth to build civilization 

Over 1000 years of economic history, there are 3 critical inflection points.  Here is a 5min video clip from Dearing VC firm Harrison Metal, via [5min video](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/capitalism).

Per capital GDP was flat for 800 years after 1000BC.  There were plenty of smart people and critical innovations, but the firms they created often topped out around 30 people.  Suddenly, in the 19th century, output per person accelerated rapidly. 

Creative genius plus energy innovation created the accelerating GDP per capita.  The idea that inventors could be enabled by investors and managers started to be embraced.  Now projects could be financed (changes in unit economics and timelines) and well-managed (professional managers increase efficiency of resource utilization) creating explosive growth in the size and number of firms.  

New ideas spread and destroyed old ways of doing world.  This is Schumpeters Creative Destruction.  Dearing reads from Schumpeter: 

> A process of business mutation, to borrow a term from biology, that creates a cycle of Creative Destruction.

The outcome is people you've never heard of starting businesses you can't believe are real completely unsettling the economic outputs by remodeling the economy itself.

## How Does Innovation Happen

1.  Cheap energy helps
2.  Sharing of ideas (less manual labour on farms -> more intellectual efforts)
3.  Technical innovation (transportation, mechanization of spinning cotton)

### Al Chandler: founded disciple of business history at Harvard.

Schumpeter is right: entrepreneurs play KEY role in industrial processes, and growing the economy, but managers play a similarly vital role in scaling these innovations.  Proper management is required to scale.

Chandler believes that managerial capitalism is a fundamental invention that came with industrial capitalism. 

> Chandler calls managerial capitalism: **The Visible Hand**

General managers amplified the creative/destructive genius and amplified the productivity of capital.

## Humans invest surplus wealth to make things better.

Output increases fund health care, education and all kinds of social movements.  They are funded by the fortunes of industrialization.  Capitalism creates the cures for the worst parts of human condition. 



### Start Up Stages (3)

Start ups need to have a Technical Insight, then a Product, then a Business.  Each stage is unique and present various new challenges. 

### Operations

McCallum accidentally gave us a beautiful scorecard for general managers.  His five challenges:

* Group works together on common goals.
* People have the right amount of responsibility.
* Team gets the job done.
* General Manager knows how things are going along the way.
* People feel respected.


### How to Think about Financing 

A lot of VCs are funding ventures that are not businesses.  They are either public goods, science projects or hobbies.

> Nobody came to this country because they wanted great convertible debt terms.

Convertible debt is a terrible poison in the VC industry.  People want ownership.  *Ownership ensures the best long term custodianship of assets.*  Humans want to produce things and then sell them later for more money, investors should also share ownership and be truly exposed and engaged.  

Founders should treat themselves to investors who rise and sink with their stake in your venture.

> Terrible disservice to teach founders they should be OK with debt financing or diluted, unmotived partners. 

VC math should be simple: Total Investment / ownership %.
