# Negative Income Tax: The Revolutionary Subsidy
## Adapted from Milton Friedman via [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM&ab_channel=LibertyPen). 

Help poor people by giving them money.

Rather than forcing unwanted services or burdening the poor with red tape, like chronicling their financial position, or maintaining correspondence with various government offices, before receiving aid.  The welfare state in developed countries does hand-outs very inefficiently.  There are departments for each basic necessity: affordable housing, food, health care and multiple programs just for children, etc.

Basic formula for negative income tax is to apply tax rates on the basis of median income.  Friedman offers maximum of 50% of median income as the largest possible subsidy.

> Assume median income of $50,000.  Joe Smith earns $30,000 and therefore has negative income of $20k (median income -actual income).  Joe would then receive a negative income tax of $10,000 bringing the sum of his income to $40,000 for the year. 

If the government handed out 100% of the deficit, they would destroy the incentive to work. 

By capping the subsidy at half of median income, someone who earns $0 would receive $25,000 (borrowing the median income of $50k from above).  This is the maxmimum negative income tax.

Such a revolutionary subisidy would eliminate the need for costly administration of welfare states, and effectively reduce the size of government, and public debts.  Creating a greater pool of capital in the hands of private citizens will increase consumption give people the greatest opportunity to deploy the capital into the most desired uses.
