## Summary

Chilton is huge on user testing.  Both for books and products.  He likes to invest in a barbell approach, combining highly speculative equity positions (small caps, VC) and buy-and-hold-forever with low-cost, broad-based, index funds.

> "My due diligence is borderline crazy.  I will call brokerage firms, diplomats, consulates, IMF ambassadors, etc.  Few people are willing to do this kind of due diligence."


## Publishing is Broken, Listen to the Readers

> Use the dedication page more effectively.

"I dedicate this to my two fabulous wives, may they never meet."

Dedications are a great place to write something meaningful, to show character.


Forewards are garbage.  They are half-asses, and literally someone elses words.  Over 90% of forewords test poorly with readers.  90%.

Editors aren't able to make changes to forewards because someone else wrote it!


> You wouldn't make a music album and have the 1st track by another artist.

Shorter testimonials are much better than longer, and short testimonials are much, much better than forewards.

Forewards and acknowledgments at the front are a relic of publishing industry.  Cruft inherited from a previous generations misinformation.

## Readers Prefer Short Chapters

Has been increasing every year, too.  Short chapters increase likelihood of finishing book, and recommend the book.  Chilton comes by this through prolific human testing.
